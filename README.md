Step 7: Authenticate to OpenShift 3 with the web console

Now that we have everything up and running, you probably want to authenticate to the platform.  Letâ€™s start by using the web console.  Open up your browser and go to the following URL:

## Vagrant Centos Gui
```
config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
  v.gui = true
  v.memory = 2048
  v.cpus = 2
end
```

### Log into your vm:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

Then switch to root:

```
$ sudo -i 
```

Then install the gui desktop collection of packages:

```
$ yum groupinstall -y 'gnome desktop'
$ yum install -y 'xorg*'
```


Next uninstall the following packages:

```
yum remove -y initial-setup initial-setup-gui
```

These packages are to do with agreeing to EULA agreements, which means it requires user interaction, which can prevent automated startups via vagrant.

### Next switch to the gui target:

```
$ systemctl isolate graphical.target
$ systemctl set-default graphical.target   # to make this persistant
```

You should now see the gui desktop in your virtualbox window. If not, then try restarting the box:

```
$ vagrant halt ; vagrant up
```
